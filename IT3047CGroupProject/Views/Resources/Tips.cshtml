<h1>Photography Tips for Better Photos</h1>

<p>
    These quick tips are aimed at beginners using the cameras listed on our main Camera Options page.
</p>

<h2>1. Use the rule of thirds</h2>
<p>
    Turn on the grid in your camera and try placing your subject along one of the grid lines
    instead of directly in the center. This usually makes your composition more interesting.
</p>

<h2>2. Watch your light</h2>
<p>
    Soft, indirect light (early morning, late afternoon, or window light) usually looks better
    than harsh midday sun. Pay attention to where the shadows fall on your subject’s face.
</p>

<h2>3. Keep your shutter speed fast enough</h2>
<p>
    For handheld shots, a simple rule is to keep your shutter speed at least
    <code>1 / focal length</code>. For example, at 50mm, try to stay at 1/60s or faster
    to reduce motion blur.
</p>

<h2>4. Clean up the background</h2>
<p>
    A clean background can make a huge difference. Move a few steps left or right to avoid
    distractions like trash cans, poles “growing” out of someone’s head, or random clutter.
</p>

<h2>5. Practice with one lens</h2>
<p>
    Instead of switching lenses constantly, spend a day shooting only with a single focal length.
    You’ll start to “see” in that focal length and improve your framing and composition.
