<h1>About Our Photography Hobby</h1>

<p>
    This site is our final project for IT3047C. We chose <strong>photography</strong> as our hobby
    because it combines creativity, technology, and storytelling. Our goal is to give new
    photographers a simple place to explore camera options and find ideas for where and how to shoot.
</p>

<h2>What this website includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera Options:</strong> A database-backed list of cameras (brand, model, price, description).</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Locations:</strong> A categorized list of locations that are great for shooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Gear suggestions and practical tips for getting better photos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why we like photography</h2>
<p>
    Photography lets us freeze a moment in time. Whether it’s a landscape, a city scene,
    or a portrait, there’s always something new to learn – from exposure settings, to
    composition, to editing. It fits well with our interest in technology because modern
    cameras and editing tools are basically specialized computers with lenses.
